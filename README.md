# Web3 Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey into **Web3 development** — experimenting with **Ethereum concepts**, **EIPs**, and **smart contracts**.  
It’s a mix of **learning notes**, **working code**, and **small projects** I build along the way.

---

## 📌 Current Focus

- Understanding and implementing **EIP-7702 (ephemeral delegation)**  
- Writing **Solidity contracts** for wallet delegation and fund withdrawals  
- Using **ethers.js v6** to interact with the Ethereum blockchain  
- Experimenting with **gas abstraction** (separating gas payer from owner)  

---

## 🔑 Key Learnings

- **Delegating** an EOA to a contract using **EIP-7702**  
- Why **nonce + 1** is sometimes required when authorizing delegation  
- **Revoking delegation** by resetting to the **zero address**  
- **Gas abstraction**: using a different wallet to pay transaction fees
